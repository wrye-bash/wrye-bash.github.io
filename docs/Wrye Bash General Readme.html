<h2 id="intro">Introduction <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h2>
<p>Wrye Bash is a powerful mod management utility for games based on Bethesda's Creation Engine. Its features include:
<ul>
    <li>A mod installation and conflict manager
    <li>A plugin load order manager
    <li>Increased mod compatibility
    <li>Lifting of the 255 plugin limit through automatic merging of compatible mods
    <li>.ini and settings files tweak management
    <li>Screenshot management
    <li>And many, many more
</ul>
<p>It currently supports the following games:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oblivion</li>
    <li>Fallout 3</li>
    <li>Fallout&colon; New Vegas</li>
    <li>Skyrim</li>
    <li>Enderal&colon; Forgotten Stories</li>
    <li>Fallout 4</li>
    <li>Skyrim&colon; Special Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrye Bash can appear daunting at first. To help make it more manageable, the documentation has been split into a few readmes that are targeted towards different usage requirements.
<p>This readme covers only the most commonly used features, so that the average user can start using Wrye Bash without being overwhelmed. Information on the less commonly used features and more technical details of the features covered in this readme may be found in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html">Advanced Readme</a>. Information on some of the syntaxes and file formats that Wrye Bash uses are found in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html">Technical Readme</a>. Finally, Wrye Bash's version history is stored in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Version%20History.html">Version History</a> document.</p>

<h3 id="intro-glossary">Glossary <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Modding for Creation Engine games has a wonderful history of confusing terminology. The list below details some terms commonly used when dealing with mods.
<ul>
    <li><strong>The game</strong> is the game that Wrye Bash is managing, one of the ones listed above.</li>
    <li><strong>CTD</strong> is an acronym for Crash To Desktop. Used to describe the game crashing.</li>
    <li><strong>DLC</strong> refers to any of the official downloadable content for the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Mod</strong> refers to any unofficial user-made modification to the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Mod author</strong> refers to a person that makes modifications to the game. It can also refer to those who are involved in the creation of utilities that are used by mod authors and/or users.</li>
    <li><strong>ESM</strong> (case-sensitive) or <strong>ESM-flagged file</strong> refers to any file that the game treats as a <strong>master</strong>. For games before Fallout 4, the only thing that mattered was a flag inside the file called the ESM flag. For newer games, files with the extension <code>.esm</code> are treated as masters too, whether they have the flag set or not. These load before all ESPs (see below). It is an acronym for Elder Scrolls Master.</li>
    <li><strong>.esm</strong> (case-sensitive) refers to files with the extension <code>.esm</code>. See the ESM entry above for notes on how they behave in different games.</li>
    <li><strong>ESP</strong> (case-insensitive) refers to any file with a <code>.esp</code> extension. It is an acronym for Elder Scrolls Plugin.</li>
    <li><strong>ESL</strong> (case-sensitive) refers to any file with a flag called the ESL flag set. Files with the extension <code>.esl</code> are treated as ESLs whether they have the flag or not. Only Fallout 4 and Skyrim&colon; Special Edition currently support these. Certain restrictions apply as to which plugins can be ESL-flagged. They do not take up a regular load order slot, theoretically allowing up to 4096 plugins to be loaded.</li>
    <li><strong>.esl</strong> (case-sensitive) refers to files with the extension <code>.esl</code>. These automatically receive the ESL and ESM flags. Only Fallout 4 and Skyrim&colon; Special Edition currently support them.</li>
    <li><strong>ESU</strong> (case-insensitive) refers to any file with a <code>.esu</code> extension. These are an unofficial type of plugin used by xEdit. It is an acronym for Elder Scrolls Update.</li>
    <li><strong>Plugin</strong> refers to any of the above file types.</li>
    <li><strong>Master</strong> refers to any plugins that another plugin is dependent on to function. (It can also refer to an ESM file, as it used to be that only ESMs could be masters, until mod authors developed methods of using ESP files as masters too. The latter definition will not be used in this documentation.)</li>
    <li><strong>The game's master file</strong> refers to the ESM that must be loaded for the game to function. A short table showing the master file for each game follows:</li>
    <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Game</th><th>Master File</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Oblivion</td><td>Oblivion.esm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fallout 3</td><td>Fallout3.esm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fallout&colon; New Vegas</td><td>FalloutNV.esm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Skyrim</td><td>Skyrim.esm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Enderal&colon; Forgotten Stories</td><td>Skyrim.esm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fallout 4</td><td>Fallout4.esm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Skyrim&colon; Special Edition</td><td>Skyrim.esm</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <li><strong>Conflicts</strong> occur when two different mods try to change the same game variable or resource, which could be anything from a specific object in game to a script or a texture. Conflicts can cause problems, including CTDs or save game corruption, but they are not inherently bad, and most modding is the result of purposeful conflicts.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Conflicts</strong> occur when two mods contain two different files that go in the same place, so one mod's file overwrites the others's file. This type of conflict can be managed by altering the install order of mods.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Conflicts</strong> occur when two mod plugins alter the same game data. This type of conflict can be managed by altering the load order of plugins or creating patches.</li>
    <li><strong>BSAs</strong> are Bethesda Softwork Archives, with <code>.bsa</code> (<strong>All but Fallout 4</strong>) or <code>.ba2</code> (<strong>Fallout 4</strong>) file extensions. They can be used to store resource files such as textures and meshes.</li>
    <li><strong>ITMs</strong> are Identical To Master records, ie. data in a plugin for something that is identical to the data for that thing in the plugin's master(s). Usually a type of unintended edit, known as a <q>dirty edit</q>, which can break the functionality of other mods that require the record in question to have a specific value, but which have that value overridden by an ITM record.</li>
    <li><strong>UDRs</strong> are Undeleted and Disabled References. Deleted References can cause crashes, and this can be avoided by first undeleting and then disabling them instead. A type of <q>dirty edit</q>. Note that this acronym does not refer to the deleted references themselves - it actually refers to their fixed counterparts. For example, <q>Scan For UDRs</q> will scan for deleted references, not undeleted and disabled references, and BOSS/LOOT will report the UDR count for a plugin, which is actually the number of deleted references that can be fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This readme will also use the placeholder <strong>[Game]</strong>. Replace this with the game that you're managing with Wrye Bash. Additional terminology specific to Wrye Bash's functions will be introduced as required. Also, links that are followed by <img alt="External Link Icon" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAKCAYAAACNMs+9AAAAVklEQVR4Xn3PgQkAMQhDUXfqTu7kTtkpd5RA8AInfArtQ2iRXFWT2QedAfttj2FsPIOE1eCOlEuoWWjgzYaB/IkeGOrxXhqB+uA9Bfcm0lAZuh+YIeAD+cAqSz4kCMUAAAAASUVORK5CYII="/> go to pages that are not part of the Wrye Bash documentation.</p>

<h2 id="install">Installation <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h2>
<p>The simplest way to install Wrye Bash is using the installer, as it installs Wrye Bash and its dependencies automatically. However, the instructions below are provided if a manual install method is preferred.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are two versions of Wrye Bash available: the Python version and the Standalone version. Both are the same program, but the Standalone version has fewer dependencies and so is recommended for most people.
<p><strong>Windows Vista, 7, 8 &amp; 10 users:</strong> Windows' User Account Control feature may interfere with the running of Wrye Bash and other utilities. See the <a href="#trouble-permissions">File Permissions</a> section for solutions.
<p>Manual Standalone Version Installation:
<ol>
    <li>Download and install the <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/A/A/6AA4EDFF-645B-48C5-81CC-ED5963AEAD48/vc_redist.x86.exe">MSVC 2015 Redistributable (x86)</a>.
    <li>You now have a choice:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract the downloaded Wrye Bash archive into any folder.</li>
        <li>Extract the downloaded Wrye Bash archive into the game folder (e.g. <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Skyrim</q> or <q>Fallout</q>, depending on the game) so that the Mopy
        directory appears in the game folder.
    </ul>
    <li>Run Wrye Bash by double-clicking <q>Wrye Bash.exe</q> in the new Mopy folder. If you chose the second option above, Wrye Bash will now simply open. However, you will have to repeat the procedure for each new game you install.
        If you chose the second option, you will see a game select screen. Simply select one of the listed games to continue:</li>
    <img alt="Game Select Screen" src="../bash/images/readme/game-select.png"/>
</ol>
<p>Manual Python Version Installation:
<ol>
    <li>Download and install all the required Python libraries and python itself.
        See the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#install-components">Python Components</a> section of the Advanced readme
        for the list of included libraries and their versions. If you have previously installed Python and any Python libraries,
        you may not need to install them again.
    <li>Download and install the <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/A/A/6AA4EDFF-645B-48C5-81CC-ED5963AEAD48/vc_redist.x86.exe">MSVC 2015 Redistributable (x86)</a>.
    <li>Extract the downloaded Wrye Bash archive into your game folder (e.g. <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Skyrim</q> or <q>Fallout</q>, depending on the game) so that the Mopy
    directory appears by the game executable. See the
    <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#install-alternate">Alternative Install Locations</a> if you wish to install to a different directory.
    <li>Navigate to the Mopy directory and run Wrye Bash by double-clicking <q>Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw</q>.
</ol>

<h2 id="uninstall">Uninstallation <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h2>
<p>The ease with which Wrye Bash can be removed is dependent on how much you use it to manage your modded game.
<ul>
    <li>If you use a Bashed Patch, you will need to remove any dependencies on it from your saves before uninstalling Wrye Bash in order to avoid in-game issues. This may be near-impossible to do, depending on what is in your Bashed Patch.
    <li>If you use BAIN to manage your installed mods, you will need to ensure that you have an adequate alternative management system ready, as although uninstalling Wrye Bash will not uninstall your mods, you will no longer be able to use BAIN's conflict resolution features.
    <li>If you use any INI tweaks applied through Wrye Bash, you will need to make a note of which tweaks you have applied, as although uninstalling Wrye Bash will not undo your tweaks, you will no longer have any record of tweaks applied or default values.
    <li>If you use the People tab, you will need to transfer your notes on people and record their karma outside of Wrye Bash.
</ul>
<p>If none of the above points apply to you, or once you have taken the necessary measures for the points that apply, you can uninstall Wrye Bash by either running the uninstaller, if you used the installer to install Wrye Bash, or delete the following files and folders if you installed it manually.
<ul>
    <li><code>[Game]\Mopy</code> - If you've edited any localisation files in the <code>l10n</code> folder that you want to keep, back them up.
    <li><code>[Game]\Data\Bash Patches</code> - If you've exported any CSV files that you want to keep, back them up.
    <li><code>[Game]\Data\BashTags</code> - If you've manually created any tag files that you want to keep, back them up.</li>
    <li><code>[Game]\Data\Docs</code>
    <li><code>[Game]\Data\INI Tweaks</code>
    <li><code>Documents\My Games\[Game]</code> - Only delete the <code>BashProfiles.dat</code>, <code>BashProfiles.dat.bak</code>, <code>BashSettings.dat</code>, <code>BashSettings.dat.bak</code>, <code>Messages.dat</code>, <code>Messages.dat.bak</code>, <code>People.dat</code> and <code>People.dat.bak</code> files and the <code>Saves\Bash</code> folder.
    <li><code>[Game] Mods</code> (in the same folder as [Game]) - The <code>Bash Installers</code> folder stores the mods you've installed via BAIN.
</ul>

<p>Wrye Bash mod installer are known as <strong><abbr title="Bash Installers">BAIN</abbr></strong> (<strong>BA</strong>sh <strong>IN</strong>stallers), and are presented on the Installers Tab. The first time the Installers tab is opened, a dialog will appear asking if BAIN should be initialized. If you click <q>Yes</q>, BAIN will be initialised, which can take some time. After that, the information refresh performed when the Installers tab is opened is much faster.</p>
    Tab. The first time the Installers tab is opened, a dialog will appear asking if BAIN should be initialized. If you click <q>Yes</q>,
    BAIN will be initialised, which can take some time. After that, the information refresh performed when the Installers tab is opened is
    much faster.
<p>BAIN's primary function is to install mod packages. <strong>BAIN Packages</strong> can be <code>.zip</code>,
    <code>.7z</code> or <code>.rar</code> archives or uncompressed directories. Uncompressed directories are called <strong>Projects</strong> while archives are usually called
    <strong>packages</strong>, abusing terminology. When we refer to projects and packages together we will be also using the collective term <strong>installers</strong>.
<p>If BAIN is disabled, ie. if you clicked <q>No</q> on the dialog that was displayed the first time you selected the Installers tab, it can be re-enabled by right clicking on a column header in the Installers tab and selecting <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bainEnabled">Enabled</a>.

<p>Installers need to be placed in the <code>Bash Installers</code> directory which is created the first time Bash runs inside the <code>"Game" Mods</code> directory. This directory is by default
    created on the same level as your game directory (that is, if your game exe is located in "C:\GAMES\TESIV\Oblivion", then by default Bash will create the "C:\GAMES\TESIV\Oblivion Mods\"
    directory on first run), but you can point Bash to create this "Game" Mods directory wherever you want (or point it to an existing one) via the <code>sOblivionMods</code> ini setting. Do
    <em>not</em> however put it inside the game Data directory, as the game may well be confused and scan it adding to performance deterioration, mods thrashing.
<p>To add an installer to Wrye Bash Installers, you can either manually copy and paste the zip to the Bash Installers Directory, or just drag and drop the zip onto the Installers tab.
<p>Bash will scan the Bash Installers directory and pick up all subfolders and all <code>.zip</code>, <code>.7z</code> or <code>.rar</code> archives - except for:

<ol>
    <li>folders or files that begin with <code>--</code> will be skipped
    <li>a <code>Bain Converters</code> subdir of Bash Installers will be skipped
    <li>folders or files that begin with <code>bash</code> will be skipped
    <li>you may specify additional directories to be skipped via the <code>sSkippedBashInstallersDirs</code> ini setting
</ol>

<p>Now BAIN will try to classify the packages it detected in Bash Installers into its package formats - if it fails the package will display as unrecognized and will have to

<p>When scanning an installer (package or project) BAIN follows some rules to decide what's in there and if it can be installed. BAIN
    will search for specific directories and file extensions (bsa/ba2, ini, all plugin extensions). All directory detection is <em>case insensitive</em>.
    Directories BAIN is aware of, independently of the game, are:</p>
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Wrye Bash Directory</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>bashtags</td><td>Its contents will be copied inside <code>Data/BashTags</code>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>bash patches</td><td>BAIN will install files in this folder from packages, usually in the form of <code>.csv</code> files.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>docs</td><td>Its contents will be copied inside <code>Data/Docs</code>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ini tweaks</td><td>INI tweaks inside this will be installed in <code>Data/Ini Tweaks/</code> and appear on the INI Tab - do <strong>not</strong> include subfolders in <code>ini tweaks</code>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>screenshots</td><td>Its contents will be copied inside <code>Data/Docs</code>.</td></tr>
        <tr class="tabttl"><th colspan="2">Game Directories Supported For All Games</th>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td colspan="2"><div class="bain-structure-txtcnt">ini, meshes, music, sound, textures, video</div></td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are also game-specific directories:</p>

<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Game</th><th>Extra Game Directories</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Oblivion</td><td>_tejon, distantlod, facegen, fonts, menus, obse, pluggy, scripts, shaders, streamline, trees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fallout 3</td><td>config, distantlod, facegen, fonts, fose, menus, uio, scripts, shaders, trees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fallout&colon; New Vegas</td><td>config, distantlod, facegen, fonts, menus, nvse, uio, scripts, shaders, trees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Skyrim</td><td>asi, calientetools, dialogueviews, dyndolod, grass, interface, lodsettings, scripts, seq, shadersfx, skse, skyproc patchers, strings, tools</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Enderal&colon; Forgotten Stories</td><td>asi, calientetools, dialogueviews, dyndolod, grass, interface, lodsettings, scripts, seq, shadersfx, skse, skyproc patchers, strings, tools</td></tr>

    </tbody>
</table>

All these directories (either in the Global or Extra and Bonus Game directories) constitute the <strong>standard game directories</strong> for this game. If
<a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bainHasExtraDirectories">Has Extra Directories</a> is not on for the package, any other top level directory in the (sub)package
will be skipped (and their content listed in Skipped tab). There are also some directories and files that will be always skipped (for all the gory details see
<a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bain-skipped">Skipped Files</a>).

<p>There are, loosely speaking, three types of BAIN-compatible package structures:

<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Structure<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Simple<td>Installer has .esp, .esm and/or .bsa files, and/or any of the standard game subdirectories at the top level of the package/project.
        <tr><td>Complex<td>Installer has top-level subdirectories that each have a simple structure (as defined above). The top level
            subdirectories (known as subpackages) <strong>must NOT have the same name as any of the standard game directories for this game</strong>
            (like docs, or meshes). Otherwise BAIN thinks this is a simple package and will skip subpackages.<br>
            Each top-level subdirectory will be treated as a sub-package, and can be independently activated or deactivated as desired.
        <tr><td>Complex/Simple<td>A complex installer with only one top-level subdirectory. It is treated as a simple installer, starting at this
            top level subdirectory. Examples include mods packaged with a top-level Data directory.
</table>

<h3 id="bain-convert">Restructuring Packages to be BAIN-Compatible <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>The easiest way to tell if a package needs manual converting to be compatible with BAIN is to try installing it. If it is listed in the Package list with a grey checkbox and name, then BAIN cannot install it. Due to BAIN's flexibility, many mods are already packaged in ways that are compatible, but for those that are not, there are a few possible cases:
<ul>
    <li>The mod has a <abbr title="BAIN Conversion File">BCF</abbr>. BCFs are special packages that tell BAIN how to restructure the mod to be compatible with BAIN without the user having to do any work.
    <li>The mod is distributed as an OMOD (ie. has file extension <code>.omod</code>). These mods are intended for installation with the Oblivion Mod Manager or Nexus Mod Manager. Such mods usually have a non-OMOD download option: if one is available, download that instead as it is more likely to be compatible. Otherwise, OMOD files can be converted to Projects automatically by dragging and dropping them into the Installers tab.
    <li>The mod is distributed as an archive, or is a converted OMOD Project, but doesn't have a folder structure that BAIN recognises. It will need manual restructuring.
    <li>The mod is distributed as an executable (ie. has file extension <code>.exe</code>). This is very rare, as mods do not require the complexity of executables, and the greater security risk executables represent makes their use unpopular. BAIN cannot install mods distributed in this way: often the only way to install them is to run the executable. You can often run the installer, installing to a dummy folder, and then repack the <q>installed</q> files into a BAIN-compatible format.
</ul>
<p>If an archive has a BCF, it can be converted for installation with BAIN using the following instructions.
<ol>
    <li>Ensure that the BCF is installed in the correct location, <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters</code>. Also ensure that the archive(s) it converts is/are in <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers</code>.
    <li>From the BAIN installers list, select the archive(s) to be converted (i.e., the <q>source</q> packages) and right click on the selected file(s) to bring up the context menu, and select <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bainConversion">Conversions</a> to open the sub-menu.
    <li>Click on <em>Apply</em> to open a second sub-menu and select the BCF from it. There may be more than one BCF listed if multiple installed BCFs can convert the selected package(s).
    An asterisk ('*') is added to the end of a BCF's name for every archive it converts that isn't selected.
    <li>Optionally choose a name for the converted archive(s).
    <li>Once Wrye Bash has finished the conversion, the converted archive(s) will appear in the BAIN package list ready for install. You can now delete the original archive(s).
</ol>
<p>If a package is unrecognised by BAIN and has no associated BCF, its contents will have to be rearranged so that the structure matches one of the three types of BAIN-compatible package structures.</p>

<h3 id="bain-install">Installing/Uninstalling Via BAIN <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Packages must first be placed in the <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers</code> directory. This can either be done via Windows Explorer, or by dragging and dropping the package into the Wrye Bash window when the Installers tab is open. If you drag and drop, you will be asked whether you want to copy the package or move it.
<p>If a package contains a Wizard (ie. there is <img alt="a wand icon" src="../bash/images/wizard.png"/> overlaid on its checkbox):
<ol>
    <li>Right-click the package and select <a href="#bainWizard">Wizard</a>. You can also choose to install using the Wizard's default options by selecting <a href="#bainAutoWizard">Auto Wizard</a>.
    <li>If you chose <a href="#bainWizard">Wizard</a>, navigate through the steps of the Wizard to install the package. Otherwise, you will be skipped to the Wizard finish screen.
    <li>At the Wizard's finish screen, click the <q>Apply</q> button to apply its selections. The Wizard window may need to be resized for the <q>Apply</q> button to become visible.
</ol>
<p>If a package has a Simple or a Complex/Simple structure:
<ol>
    <li>Select the package in the package list.
    <li>Choose which plugins to install from it using the <q>Plugin Filter</q> box to the far right of the package list. Checked plugins will be installed, while unchecked plugins will be skipped.
    <li>Right-click the package and select <a href="#bainInstall">Install</a>.
</ol>
<p>If a package has a Complex structure:
<ol>
    <li>Select the package in the package list.
    <li>Choose which sub-packages to install from the <q>Sub-Package</q> box to the right of the package list. Checked sub-packages will be installed, while unchecked sub-packages will be skipped.
    <li>Choose which plugins to install from it using the <q>Plugin Filter</q> box to the far right of the package list. Checked plugins will be installed, while unchecked plugins will be skipped.
    <li>Right-click the package and select <a href="#bainInstall">Install</a>.
</ol>
<p>If you install a package then later change the sub-packages or plugin files selected, you can apply these changed by right-clicking the package in the list and selecting <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a>. A Wizard provides a scripted installation method that can be useful for more complex mods with many options.
<p>When a package is installed, BAIN installs any files that appear to be documentation into the <code>Data\Docs</code> folder. Any files that are simply named <q>readme</q> (eg. readme.txt, readme.html, readme.doc) will be renamed according to the package name to prevent packages overwriting each other's readmes.
<p>To uninstall any package from the Installers tab select the package
and right click on it, then select <a href="#bainUninstall">Uninstall</a>.
This will uninstall
all Matched files. However, BAIN will not uninstall Mismatched files.
A Mismatched file is a file that has been altered after it was
installed. The reason BAIN does not uninstall Mismatched files is BAIN
 has no way of tracking the source of the alteration if it was not
done through BAIN. For example, if the file was altered because it was
 replaced by another mod that was installed manually,
then uninstallation of the Mismatched file may not be desirable. On
the other hand, if the file was altered because it was cleaned or
edited with TESxEdit, or because it was an ini file that was edited
with a text editor, then it may be desired to uninstall the Mismatched
 file along with the package that it came from. Such files could be
deleted from the data folder manually, but there is an easy way to do
this through BAIN. Before uninstalling the mod, first select the
package and right click on it, then select <a href="#bainInstall">Install</a>.
This will
overwrite any Mismatched files with the version of the file contained
in the package, making them Matched. Now select <a href="#bainUninstall">Uninstall</a>
and BAIN
will uninstall all installed files associated with this package.
You can also uninstall packages that BAIN hasn't installed, which will
 remove any installed files that match the ones in the package. This
is useful for cleaning out mods that were manually installed. Of course you
    need to add the packages to BAIN first.
Uninstalling via BAIN respects the ownership of files,
ie. uninstalling a mod that contains files also installed by a mod
listed lower in the installation order will not uninstall the lower
mod's files. See the next section, BAIN Package Order for more on
this. However, if the Auto-Anneal option is enabled (the default), then files
from other packages previously overridden by the uninstalled package's
 files will be automatically restored.</p>

<h3 id="bain-order">BAIN Package Order <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>The Install Order of packages in BAIN is important as this decides which package gets its files installed in the case of resource
    conflicts.Packages may be listed in Install Order by left-clicking on the <q>Order</q> column header. If two packages try to install the
    same file, then the package installing later in the list will have its file overwrite the file of the package installing earlier in the
    list. For example, files in a package in install order position 06, would overwrite conflicting files in a package at install order
    position 04. Note that packages with a higher install order appear lower in the list of packages, and that may lead to confusion as
    people refer to them as "lower".
<p>The order of sub-packages within a package follow the same rules as packages. Checked sub-packages later (lower) in the sub-package list
    will overwrite conflicting content from sub-packages earlier (higher in the list) than them.
<p>Package conflicts are detailed in the <q>Conflicts</q> tab to the right of the package list when you select a package. This tab tells you
    which packages have which files that conflict with files in your currently-selected package. It gives this information for packages in
    the Install Order both earlier and later than the selected package in the package list.
<p>BAIN allows you to easily adjust the conflict status of packages by moving their order around. This can be done by dragging and dropping
    packages within the list, or by right-clicking packages and selecting the <a href="#bainMoveTo">Move To...</a> option. You can also
    select multiple packages and move them, in which case they will be moved as a group, retaining their order relative to one another in
    their new location. A third option is to select the package(s) and use Ctrl-Up or Ctrl-Down to move them up or down respectively.</p>

<h3 id="bain-symbols">What Symbols &amp; Colours Mean <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>BAIN uses the colours of packages in the package list and the state of their checkboxes to convey information about their status to the user. A checkbox state may be combined with any checkbox or text colour, and the possible states and colours are described in the tables below.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Installed packages are marked with a plus, eg. <img alt="Green Plus" src="../bash/images/checkbox_green_inc.png" width="16" height="16"/>. Corrupt or incomplete packages are marked with a cross, eg. <img alt="Red X" src="../bash/images/checkbox_red_x.png" width="16" height="16"/>. Packages that begin and end with <q>==</q>, eg. <q>==Last==</q>, are marker packages. They don't represent an archive or folder and so contain no files, but may be used to organise the package list.

</figure>
<h3 id="load-overview">Overview <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Wrye Bash displays your installed plugins in its <q>Mods</q> tab. Your load order of active installed plugins, which Wrye Bash marks with a
    ticked checkbox, is important as it decides what plugin 'wins' any conflict between plugins, with later loading plugins overriding those
    that change the same thing. A mod loading later in the list will have a greater number in the Load Order column, and will "win"
    if there's a conflict with a mod loading earlier (which will have a lower number). <strong>Load order is not the same thing as BAIN install
        order!</strong> Install order determines which package's files overwrite other packages files when they conflict.
<p>Although in general "Load Order" stands for the load order of the <em>active</em> plugins, all installed plugins have a load order assigned
    to them. In Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout&colon; New Vegas this is based on the modification time of the plugin,
    in Skyrim and Enderal&colon; Forgotten Stories it is based on a text-file based standard the community agreed on,
    while Fallout 4 and all later games dump all installed plugins in its plugins.txt, marking active ones with an asterisk (<code>*</code>).
    Bash needs plugin load order even for inactive plugins to correctly merge inactive mods in the Bashed Patch, for instance.</p>
<p>Plugins may be activated by clicking their checkbox so that it is ticked, or by selecting a plugin or group of plugins and pressing the
    space bar on your keyboard. Plugins may be deactivated by again clicking their checkbox or pressing the spacebar. If a group of selected
    plugins contains a mix of active and inactive plugins, pressing the space bar once will activate them all, thereafter it will function as normal.
<p>Some plugins are explicitly dependent on other plugins - they have these plugins as <q>masters</q>. When a plugin is activated, its masters are also activated. Conversely, when a plugin upon which other plugins depend is deactivated, those plugins are also deactivated.</p>
<p>When setting the load order, make sure that Wrye Bash is displaying your plugins sorted by Load Order. Do so by clicking on the <q>Load Order</q> column header near the top of the tab. You can also display the plugins sorted by other attributes by clicking on any of the other column headers. Clicking twice will reverse the display order for any column but Load Order. The load order of plugins is given in hexadecimal digits, from 00 to FE, which is 0 to 254 in decimal. (This number also forms the first two digits of a record's Form ID.)
<p>Note that you can only have a maximum of 255 plugins active at any one time, including your game's master file.
    Wrye Bash displays a plugin count in its status bar, to the right hand side, in the format <code>Mods: [active]/[installed]</code>.
<p>Generally speaking, if you end up with an invalid load order of some kind, Wrye Bash will automatically fix it upon booting or refreshing,
    but a backup copy (with the <code>.bak</code> extension) will be made before doing so.</p>
<p>With the advent of <strong>ESL files</strong>, the load order system was modified.
The following list contains the most important facts you need to know about how Wrye Bash handles ESL files:</p>
<ol>
    <li>.esl files implicitly receive the ESM flag, so they load among masters in the order of the plugins txt.</li>
    <li>.esl files implicitly recieve the ESL flag, so they are always treated as light plugins.</li>
    <li>ESPs with the ESL flag are also treated as light plugins.</li>
    <li>ESLs can surpass the 255 mod limit - Wrye Bash allows up to 4096, the theoretical limit,
        but your game will likely give up long before that number is reached.</li>
</ol>
<p>Creation Club ESL files (of the form <code>cc*.esl</code>) are read from the game's <code>.ccc</code> file, if the game has Creation Club support.
For example, Skyrim&colon; Special Edition uses <code>[GAME]\Skyrim.ccc</code>, while Fallout 4 uses <code>[GAME]\Fallout4.ccc</code>.
Just like the game's masters, this load order is hardcoded, and so it cannot be changed - Wrye Bash will show an error message when an attempt is made.</p>

<p>Setting up a correct load order that minimises detrimental conflicts that could cause issues in-game can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Effective load-ordering often requires a knowledge of what each plugin in your load order contains so that you can position the plugins to minimise these conflicts. For simple mods, the description in the mod's readme will usually be sufficient to determine the records it contains, but to be sure a utility such as TES4Edit is required.
<p><a href="https://loot.github.io/">LOOT</a> can be used to greatly simplify the process of setting the load order, as it can correctly position thousands of plugins automatically. However, you may still need to order some plugins manually.
<p>Wrye Bash provides a number of ways for you to set up your load order:
<ul>
    <li>Alphabetical sorting by selecting a group of plugins and choosing File-&gt;Sort from the right-click menu.
    <li>Moving plugins up or down the load order by selecting them and using Ctrl-Up or Ctrl-Down respectively. This also works with groups of plugins and preserves the group's internal order.
    <li>Dragging and dropping plugins will also change the load order if the plugins are being sorted by Load Order.
    <li><em>Oblivion only.</em> Selecting a group of plugins and choosing File-&gt;Redate from the right-click menu. This will move the first plugin to the specified date/time and position the others at one minute intervals after it.
    <li><em>Oblivion only.</em> Editing plugin modification dates in the right-hand details panel.
</ul>
<p>When running Wrye Bash, you can also lock your load order in place to prevent unintended changes to it by selecting the <a href="#modsLockLoadOrder">Lock Load Order</a>
    option in the column header right-click menu. Note that this will prevent other utilities from changing the load order, so uncheck this option if you use such a
    utility to set your load order. If you use BOSS/LOOT to manage your load order and you also use Lock Load Order, ensure
    <a href="#launchersBOSSDisableLockLoadOrder">BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</a> is also enabled to allow BOSS/LOOT to function correctly.
<p>Note that for Skyrim and later games Wrye Bash will automatically undo any changes to load order done made by the game's launcher or any utility that does not follow the textfile-based
    load order standard in order to maintain a fully coherent load order. This effectively means that unintended changes are prevented.</p>

<h3 id="load-undo">Undo and redo Load Order changes <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Bash features a sophisticated undo/redo load order feature, comprising both load order changes <em>of active <strong>or</strong> inactive
    plugins</em> and activating/de-activating plugins. Whether you activate a plugin, drag and drop it in another position, deactivate a
    plugin (having its children deactivated too) etc, you can always hit <code>Ctrl+Z</code> <em>while the list of mods has focus</em> to undo
    the operation or <code>Ctrl+Y</code> to redo it. Bash keeps the load orders (meaning total load order of <em>all</em> installed plugins
    and active state of the plugins) in its internal structures and will persist those on disc on shutting down,
    in <code>My Games\&lt;Game&gt;\BashLoadOrders.dat</code>, so you can undo/redo on restarting Bash.
<p>The undo/redo feature will try to preserve as many load orders as possible - so unlike undo/redo in other applications if you have an
    initial load order state A then change it to B, then hit undo (so you are back on state A), then change it to C Bash will keep in its
    internal structures the load order states A C B while most other applications would end up with A C. Undo/redo load order state is a
    relatively new feature (available in 307 beta) so it may have rough edges.</p>

<h3 id="load-symbols">What Symbols &amp; Colours Mean <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Like in the Installers tab, Wrye Bash uses colour-coding and other formatting effects to convey information about the state of plugins.
    The different types of formatting used and their meanings are explained here.
    Many of these can be changed in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-colors">Color Configuration</a> menu.</p>

<p>A Bashed Patch is a configurable plugin with three main functions:
<ul>
    <li>Merging plugins into itself. Merged plugins can be deactivated, avoiding the 255 plugin limit.
    <li>Importing specific types of data records from plugins. This can be used to avoid compatibility issues.
    <li>Applying tweaks to the game. This avoids the need to use other mods to apply the same tweaks.
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="patch-configuration">Bash Configuration <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>A Bashed Patch is created by Wrye Bash the first time you run it, with the plugin being called <q><strong>Bashed Patch, 0.esp</strong></q>. It is configured using the plugin context menu commands <a href="#modsRebuildPatch">Rebuild Patch...</a> or <a href="#modsRebuildPatchCBash">Rebuild Patch (CBash *Beta*)...</a>. <strong>You should rebuild your Bashed Patch every time you change your load order, before playing the game.</strong> The Bashed Patch should be last in your load order, unless you have plugins that explicitly state that they must load last.
<p>The configuration dialog consists of a list of major sections to the left, and the contents of the selected section to the right, with the build and save buttons at the bottom. The sections and their items have checkboxes: checking a section will include all its checked items in the Bashed Patch. Unchecked sections and items will not be included. Some sections don't have any items, and so just need the section checkbox checked.
<p>A short description of each section and some items is displayed near the bottom of the window if the section/item is hovered over. Bolded items are new since the last time the Bashed Patch was built. Wrye Bash will try to auto-configure most sections, but some will still need tweaking.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are currently two methods of building a Bashed Patch. One uses Python, and the other uses CBash, which is a software library written to speed up the reading of plugins. Both methods offer the same options. The CBash method is faster and allows more types of plugin to be merged, but contains some bugs as CBash is still a work in progress. CBash will become the default in the near future, once its bugs have been fixed. For now, it is probably safer to use the Python method.

<h3 id="patch-merging">Merging Plugins <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Plugins that contain only certain types of data records can be merged into the Bashed Patch. This then allows these plugins to be deactivated, freeing up space in your load order.
<p>If you're merging plugins in, you do not need the plugins active to do so.  In fact, trying to merge them in Bash will 1 - ask you to deactivate them
    before hand, and 2 - deactivate them even if you refused that prompt after the Bashed Patch has been created.
    So if you're merging plugins, leave them inactive before building, then select to merge them in the Bashed Patch build dialog.  Don't worry,
    all the algorithms for the rest of the patchers still work as you'd expect on plugins merged this way.
<p>You should check the checkboxes of all the plugins listed in the <q>Merge Patches</q> section, and ensure the section is checked too.
<p><strong>Do not remove merged mods from your Data folder.</strong> They will need to be present when you next rebuild your Bashed Patch.</p>

<h3 id="patch-importing">Importing From Plugins <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Plugins can be tagged with Bash Tags that tell Wrye Bash that they contain certain changes that should be preserved even if another mod also changes the same things. This is usually because the changes are important to the functionality of the mod. Wrye Bash then allows you to choose which plugins should have which types of changes preserved, by selecting from the various Import sections when building a Bashed Patch.
<p>If a section's description in the table below begins with <q>Preserves</q> and two or more mods in its list change the same thing, then the later-loading plugin will override the other plugin(s). Otherwise changes are merged.

<figcaption class="ini-overview-figcap">Wrye Bash's INI Edits tab, editing SkyrimPrefs.ini, Oblivion.ini, and All Natural.ini, a mod's configuration file.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Ini Edits tab allows the user to quickly apply edits to the games's INI file (e.g. Oblivion.ini, Skyrim.ini, Fallout4Custom.ini, etc.) depending on your game, and mod-added ini files, including those containing scripts used to configure mods. Edits are applied from ini tweak files, which are just a text file that contains only the lines of the ini that you wish to change. Ini tweaks are stored in the <code>Data\Ini Tweaks</code> folder, and may be installed through BAIN or placed there manually.
<p>The drop-down box allows you to select the current ini file. The <q>Browse...</q> option in the drop-down box can be used to select an ini file not listed.
<p>Selecting a tweak will display its contents in the middle column, and highlights the changes it applies to the current ini file in the right column. To apply a tweak, right click it and select <a href="#tweakApply">Apply</a>.
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Incorrect INI settings in the game INI can cause bugs, CTDs or other damage to your game. Advanced settings in particular tend to be machine-specific and should not be casually copied from one computer to another.</p>

<p>xEdit, xTrans and xView are just different modes of xEdit and will be available if the appropriate xEdit executable (e.g. Tes4Edit.exe) is available.
   The xEdit launchers have an extra option:</p>
<ul>
    <li>xEdit Expert - If checked, this option runs xEdit with the <code>-IKnowWhatImDoing</code> argument,
        activating more advanced functionality whenever xEdit is run from its launcher in the status bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tes4Gecko &amp; Oblivion Book Creator will be available if the windows path variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> points to a valid
   Java install (or the javaw.exe is present in Windows\System32) and their .jar file is present in Oblivion install directory
   or for OBC in the data directory (you can override those default paths in bash.ini).</p>
<p>The BOSS launcher has some options if BOSS v2 is installed:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Right-clicking the BOSS icon and selecting <q id="launchersBOSSDisableLockLoadOrder">BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q> will cause Wrye Bash to temporarily disable Lock Load Order
     when BOSS is run from its application launcher in the status bar, to allow BOSS to set the load order, re-enabling it after BOSS has finished running. It has no effect when BOSS
     is run from outside Wrye Bash, or when Wrye Bash is managing Skyrim or a newer game.
 <li>Right-clicking the BOSS icon and selecting the <q>Launch using GUI</q> will cause Wrye Bash to launch BOSS's GUI instead of its command line interface.
    <li>If <strong>V</strong> is pressed, it will disable version parsing.
    <li>If <strong>R</strong> is pressed, it will do a level 1 revert (to the state just prior to the last sort).
    <li>If <strong>Shift-R</strong> is pressed, it will do a level 2 revert (to the state just prior to the 2nd last sort).
    <li>If <strong>S</strong> is pressed, it will run BOSS in its silent mode, so that the BOSS Log does not automatically open once it has finished running.
    <li>If <strong>C</strong> is pressed, it will run BOSS with its Display File CRCs option enabled, so that plugin CRCs are displayed in the BOSS Log.

<p>To do this find and Right Click on a tools .exe file, and choose send to desktop
<p>Copy this Icon from the desktop and paste it into the Mopy \ Apps \ folder ( The temporary desktop icon copy can now be deleted )
<p>When you next run Wrye Bash the icon will be in the Launcher Bar, and you can Drag and drop the new icon to a desired position
<p>Be careful not to use up all the available space and prevent tooltip messages appearing next to the Launcher Bar</p>

<h2 id="trouble">Troubleshooting <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h2>
<h3 id="trouble-dump">Generating A Bug Dump <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>If Wrye Bash encounters an issue, it will generate a bug dump that will appear in a popup window. If an issue is encountered during startup, Wrye Bash may be unable to create the popup window, and so the bug dump will be saved to a log file, either <code>bash.log</code> or <code>Wrye Bash.exe.log</code> depending on the version of Wrye Bash you use. If no log file is present, then you will have to generate it yourself, using the steps below.
<ol>
    <li>Open a command prompt. This can be done by selecting Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt.
    <li>Change the working directory to the <code>Mopy</code> directory. E.g. <code>cd /D "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Mopy"</code> if Wrye Bash is installed for Oblivion.
    <li>If using the Python version of Wrye Bash: Run <code>"Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d &gt; bash.log</code>.
    <ul>
        <li>If that does not work, try <code>"C:\python27\python.exe" "Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d</code>. This assumes that you have Python 2.7 installed to the default directory. Adjust the above to reference the correct path if not.
    </ul>
    If using the Standalone version of Wrye Bash: Run <code>"Wrye Bash.exe" -d</code>.
</ol>
<p>The log file will detail the cause of the problem that is stopping Wrye Bash from starting. Read it and the rest of this section to see if the problem is something you can fix yourself. If not, report it to an official Wrye Bash thread for support.</p>

<h3 id="trouble-permissions">File Permissions <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or later, Wrye Bash (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature.  There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
    <li>Install the game outside <q>Program Files</q> or <q>Program Files (x86)</q>. UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily. Steam users can move their Steam installation and games using <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129">these instructions</a>.
    <li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
    <li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
    <li>Do nothing.  Wrye Bash will detect if it needs to run as Administrator, and give you a dialog with a few options:
        <ol>
            <li>Start Wrye Bash as Administrator:  This will give Wrye Bash full Administrator Rights, allowing it to function fully with no further action, with one exception:
                <ul>
                    <li>You will not be able to drag and drop archives into the Installers window to move or copy those archives into BAIN.  This is because non-Admin processes (explorer.exe) are not allowed to communicate with Admin processes (Wrye Bash) in this manner.
                </ul>
            <li>Start normally.  This will start Wrye Bash without Administrator Rights.
                <ul>
                    <li>Many actions that require Administrator Privileges will cause a UAC prompt to be shown.  Commonly, these are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first time Wrye Bash is started, approximately 4-6 times, depending on the number of directories Wrye Bash needs to create.
                            <li>When the Bashed Patch is rebuilt, 2 times, once for the Bashed Patch itself, once for the associated readme.
                            <li>Installing, Uninstalling, Annealing, and other operations in the Installers Tab that require modification of the game's Data folder.
                            <li>On shutdown, you may be prompted multiple times when saving various .dat files to the Bash Installers and Bash Mod Data folders, if these folders are under UAC protection.
                        </ul>
                    <li>A few actions are restricted:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Saving files into the UAC protected area: Windows does not allow the Save File dialog to select a target within a UAC protected folder.
                            <li>Ghosting: Wrye Bash will not be able to un-ghost already ghosted mods.  Wrye Bash will not ghost mods.  Both of these require renaming mod files.
                            <li>Other actions that require Administrator Privileges may not have workarounds coded.  Be warned, any errors you encounter while running as a non-Admin under a UAC protected directory will most likely not be fixed.  Follow one of the alternate solutions to solve these errors.
                        </ul>
                </ul>
        </ol>
        Launching Wrye Bash with some command line switches can avoid this dialog:
        <ul>
            <li>--no-uac: Always start normally, without Administrator Privileges
            <li>--uac: Always start as Administrator (if required)
        </ul>
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>

<h3 id="trouble-backup">Backing Up &amp; Restoring Settings <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>The easiest method is to just run the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools">Backup Settings</a> and/or <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools">Restore Settings</a> commands, which are available in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Settings menu</a>. These commands do not backup/restore any mod files or saves, just the Wrye Bash settings/data. When run, the commands ask you for the location you wish to back up to or restore from.
<p>If you wish to manually back up your settings, the directories Wrye Bash stores files in are below.
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Directory<th>Contents
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>[Game]\Mopy								<td>Main Bash files. If you're working on any localisation files in <code>Mopy\l10n</code> you may want to back them up.
        <tr><td>[Game]\Data\Bash Patches					<td>Contains CSV files used by the import/export functions. Back up any CSV files you've exported and want to keep.
        <tr><td>[Game]\Data\BashTags					<td>Contains text files with Bash Tag overrides. Only needs backing up if you added any custom files (i.e. ones not installed through BAIN).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>[Game]\Data\Docs							<td>Contains mod readmes. Doesn't need backing up.
        <tr><td>[Game]\Data\INI Tweaks					<td>Contains ini tweaks. Only needs backing up if you've added custom ini tweaks.
        <tr><td>Documents\My Games\[Game]					<td>Contains Wrye Bash settings. It is important to back this up.
        <tr><td>[Game] Mods (in the same folder as [Game])<td>Contains BAIN packages and other Wrye Bash settings. it is important to back this up.

<h3 id="trouble-report">How To Report Bugs Helpfully <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Bugs should be reported in an official Wrye Bash thread (links can be found in the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section of this document). In order to best help you, the following information is required.
<ul>
    <li>Your Wrye Bash version. This includes whether it's the Python or Standalone install, the version number and the SVN number (the latter only if using the SVN).
    <li>The symptoms. Provide a step-by-step description of what you did, what you expected and what happened.
    <li>What you see. Error messages are very helpful.
    <li>Your version of Windows. If you're using Windows with UAC enabled and you have your game in the default install directory, please resolve any permissions issues using one of the methods in the <a href="#trouble-permissions">File Permissions</a> section before reporting any bugs.
    <li>Any modifications you have made to your bash.ini, if you are using one.
    <li>If you're having an issue with the Standalone version, make sure to uninstall any Python components on your computer and try again, as they can sometimes interfere.
    <li>If the issue is related to the <a href="#patch">Bashed Patch</a>, please include the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Your load order. Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting <a href="#modsListMods">List Mods...</a>.
        <li>Your Bash Tags. Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting <a href="#modsListBashTags">List Bash Tags...</a>.
        <li>Your <a href="#patch">Bashed Patch</a> config. Get this by right clicking on the <a href="#patch">Bashed Patch</a> and selecting <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#modsListPatchConfig">List Patch Config...</a>.

                <li>Avoid rebuilding the Bashed Patch after using BAIN.  Instead, restart Wrye Bash, then rebuild the Bashed Patch.
                <li>If running the Python source, try enabling the LAA flag on python.exe and pythonw.exe.  For 64-bit OS users, this may allow Wrye Bash up to almost 4GB of memory before crashing.
                <li>If running the Standalone executable, try enabling the LAA flag on Wrye Bash.exe.

<h3>Packaged Programs <a class="back2top" href="#contents">Back to top</a></h3>
<p>Additionally, Wrye Bash comes packaged with the following programs:
<ul>
    <li>LOOT API Python Module
    <ul>
        <li>Website: <a href="https://github.com/loot/loot-api-python">GitHub</a>
        <li>License: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL 3.0</a>
        <li>Usage: Wrye Bash uses this library to retrieve Bash Tag suggestions and Dirty mod information from LOOT's plugin databases.
    </ul>
    <li>CBash
    <ul>
        <li>Website: <a href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/CBash">GITHUB</a>
        <li>License: Triple-license <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/1.1/">MPL 1.1</a>/<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL 2.0</a>/<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL 2.1</a>
        <li>Details:
        <ul>
            <li>cint.py - For v0.7.0, cint.py is in sync between Wrye Bash vs CBash repos, at the time of writing this.
            <li>C/C++ Source Code: Version 0.7.x of CBash is built off directly from the GITHUB source code, which can be found in the CBash github repository, <a href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/CBash">here</a>.
            <li>The code is for all intents and purposes the same as the old v0.6.x CBash version, just with a few minor fixes and an updated runtime dependence on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48234">Microsoft's Universal C Runtime</a> which should be already installed on any Windows 7 PC that's normally updated through the Windows Update system.</li>
            <li>Original CBash project was hosted in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cbash/">SourceForge</a>, but now the code that is present there is for the old v0.6.x version, minus some changes contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Ethatron/CBash">Ethathron</a>, and later forked by <a href="https://github.com/lojack5/CBash">Lojack5</a> (which, in turn, was the ancestor of the <a href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/CBash">current development repository</a>.)</li>
            <li>The state of that old SourceForge repository was imported to <a href="https://github.com/leandor/CBashSF.git">this</a> GITHUB read-only mirror, for easier sharing and branching, and history keeping reasons.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>7zip:
    <ul>
        <li>Website: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip.org</a>
        <li>License: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>
        <li>Usage: Wrye Bash uses 7z to pack and unpack archives.
    </ul>
    <li>LZMA SDK:
    <ul>
        <li>Website: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html">7zip.org</a>
        <li>License: Public Domain
        <li>Usage: Wrye Bash uses lzma.exe from the SDK to unpack OBMM compressed data streams.
    </ul>
</ul>
